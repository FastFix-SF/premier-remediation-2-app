    "question": "What should I do immediately after discovering water damage?",
    "answer": "First, ensure safety by turning off electricity to affected areas if water levels are significant. Stop the water source if possible (shut off main valve for pipe breaks). Then call us immediately—fast response is critical to prevent mold growth and minimize damage. While waiting, move valuable items to dry areas and avoid walking on wet carpets, which can push water deeper into the padding.",

    "question": "How quickly can mold develop after water damage?",
    "answer": "Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours in the right conditions. That's why rapid water extraction and thorough drying are so critical. Our team responds quickly and uses professional-grade dehumidifiers and air movers to reduce moisture levels before mold has a chance to establish. If water damage isn't addressed within the first few days, mold remediation may become necessary.",

    "question": "What is the mold remediation process?",
    "answer": "Our mold remediation process includes: 1) Thorough inspection and moisture assessment, 2) Containment of affected areas to prevent spore spread, 3) HEPA air filtration to capture airborne spores, 4) Removal of mold-contaminated materials, 5) Cleaning and treatment of salvageable surfaces, 6) Drying and dehumidification, 7) Third-party clearance testing to verify success. We also address the moisture source that caused the mold.",

    "question": "Can I stay in my home or building during remediation?",
    "answer": "It depends on the scope of work. For small, contained projects, occupants can often remain in unaffected areas. For larger remediation projects—especially those involving mold, asbestos, or extensive water damage—temporary relocation may be recommended or required for safety. We'll assess your specific situation and provide clear guidance. For commercial properties, we often work in phases or after hours to minimize business disruption.",

    "question": "What is asbestos abatement and when is it needed?",
    "answer": "Asbestos abatement is the safe removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials. It's required when asbestos materials are damaged, deteriorating, or will be disturbed by renovation or demolition. Common locations include pipe insulation, floor tiles, popcorn ceilings, and roofing materials in buildings constructed before 1980. We follow strict EPA and Cal/OSHA protocols and coordinate third-party testing for clearance.",

    "answer": "Timeline varies significantly based on the extent of damage. Minor smoke damage in one room might be resolved in a few days, while major fire damage could require weeks or months of restoration work. We'll provide a detailed timeline estimate after our initial assessment. Key factors include the size of affected area, types of materials damaged, presence of structural damage, and coordination required with other contractors.",
