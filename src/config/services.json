    "longDescription": "Our trenchless pipe repair services allow damaged pipelines to be relined and returned to service instead of being dug up and fully replaced. This minimally invasive approach uses existing valve or connection points to insert a liner that hardens into a durable material, improving structural integrity, sealing leaks, and blocking tree roots. Perfect for commercial sites with landscaping or paving where excavation would be highly disruptive.",
